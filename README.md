# Fritz Bandwith

Really dirt and fast implemented tool to monitor the current bandwidth used by
the FritzBox and therefore your internet connection.

## Usage

Run `bin/fritzbandwidth`. Username and password of your fritzbox will be interactively requested the first time you start the command.

## Disclaimer

I just through this together quickly, because I had a use for it. It is neither
really configurable not is it supposed to be used by anyone else. Maybe it can
be of any use to somebody then me anyways ;).
