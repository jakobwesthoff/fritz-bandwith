# Fritz Bandwith

Really dirt and fast implemented tool to monitor the current bandwidth used by
the FritzBox and therefore your internet connection.

## Usage
Enter your credentials to be used in order to log in to the fritz box INTO the
script (variables USERNAME and PASSWORD) and run the bin/fritz-bandwidth file.

## Disclaimer
I just through this together quickly, because I had a use for it. It is neither
really configurable not is it supposed to be used by anyone else. Maybe it can
be of any use to somebody then me anyways ;).
